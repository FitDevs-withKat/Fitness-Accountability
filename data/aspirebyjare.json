  "why": "Within the last year I have gone through a bit of a metamorphosis. I got in to the best shape of my life. Not only physically but financially and mentally as well. I did this by analyzing and directly challenging the insecurities I held about myself. Along the way I fell in love with the process of challenging myself to pursue a new goal. Now that I have achieved many of my lifelong goals, I am attempting to actively redesign my life in my own terms. Fitdevs provides three ideals that I want to construct as pillars in my future life. I want to maintain an active and healthy lifestyle, I want to make a living by developing software, and I yearn for a sense of comradery with like minded individuals.",
